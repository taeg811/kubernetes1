<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Configure a Pod to Use a ConfigMap</title></head><body><p>Many applications rely on configuration which is used during either application initialization or runtime. Most of the times there is a requirement to adjust values assigned to configuration parameters. ConfigMaps is the kubernetes way to inject application pods with configuration data. ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. This page provides a series of usage examples demonstrating how to create ConfigMaps and configure Pods using data stored in ConfigMaps. You can use either kubectl create configmap or a ConfigMap generator in kustomization.yaml to create a ConfigMap. Note that kubectl starts to support kustomization.yaml since 1.14. Use the kubectl create configmap command to create ConfigMaps from directories, files, or literal values: kubectl create configmap <map-name> <data-source> where <map-name> is the name you want to assign to the ConfigMap and <data-source> is the directory, file, or literal value to draw the data from. The name of a ConfigMap object must be a valid DNS subdomain name. When you are creating a ConfigMap based on a file, the key in the <data-source> defaults to the basename of the file, and the value defaults to the file content. You can use kubectl describe or kubectl get to retrieve information about a ConfigMap.</p></body>
